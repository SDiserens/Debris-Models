	/* This is a somewhat modified version of Brent's algorithm for finding the
	minimum of a single-variable function.  brent_min_init( ) takes three points
	with distinct x values,  such that the middle x value has the lowest y value;
	i.e.,  it's a bracketed minimum.  (The points need not be passed in any
	particular order).
	One then enters a loop wherein one calls brent_min_next( ) to get the
	next suggested point to check;  you evaluate the function there and call
	brent_min_add( ) to update the algorithm.  Repeat until xmax-xmin is below
	a desired threshhold.
	Brent's method combines "golden search" (a not very fast method,  but
	with guaranteed linear convergence) and parabolic interpolation : find
	the quadratic fitting through the three lowest points seen thus far,  and
	look at the point that is the minimum of that quadratic.  The latter
	method is much faster,  _if_ the function really resembles a parabola
	within the bracket.  Some bookkeeping is required to detect cases where
	convergence is slow;  if that happens,  we switch back to the reliable
	golden section method for a step or two.  Thus,  even in worst-case
	scenarios,  the algorithm _will_ still converge linearly.
	I've made the following modifications :
	-- This code keeps track of the _four_ lowest points and fits a _cubic_
	polynomial to them,  and determines a minimum from that.
	-- Convergence to the minimum tends to be extremely fast for sufficiently
	"well-behaved" functions.  But even with those,  you can have problems because
	you've reduced the (say) left-hand side of the bracket a thousandfold,  but the
	right-hand side is as large as ever.  In such cases, we're probably very close
	to the minimum,  and don't have to go far into the larger side to find a point
	that is,  most likely,  past the maximum.  This "shrink" step can easily reduce
	xmax-xmin a hundredfold,  and more than that in the final steps where the
	function is effectively a parabola or cubic.
	At present,  if the large side of the bracket is more than ten times
	the size of the small side of the bracket,  we take a look at a point that
	is at xmin - (xsmall - xmin) * 3,  where xmin is our minimum point and
	xsmall is the point at the small end of the bracket.  In other words,
	we take the small end's size,  triple it,  and look that far into the
	larger bracket.
	If we're lucky (as we usually are),  this drastically reduces the size
	of the larger side of the bracket.  If not,  the smaller side is tripled
	in size (and the larger size shrinks accordingly).
	This is the result of some empirical testing,  and should be examined
	more carefully.   I'd like to have something on a more solid theoretical
	ground.  One possibility is to compute both the cubic and parabolic minima;
	the difference between them could be a gauge of the error to which we've
	determined the minimum.  Or perhaps the magnitude of the leading coefficient
	of the cubic polynomial gives us a clue as to how far the function departs
	from being a parabola.
