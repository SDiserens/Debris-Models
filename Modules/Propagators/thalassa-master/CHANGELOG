New in version 0.9.2:
* THALASSA now outputs an additional log file in the output directory,
containing useful diagnostics for the current propagation.
* Fixed an issue in atsu.for that could cause a syntax error with newer gfortran
versions.

New in version 1.0:
* The solar flux can now be considered as time-varying by setting the new 'if107'
flag in input.txt. This affects the J77 and MSIS-00 atmospheric models.
* MSIS-00 now takes into account Earth flattening.
* A set of batch scripts for large-scale propagations have been added in batch/

New in version 1.1:
* The computation of the gravitational potential has been completely rewritten,
and it is now based on the Pines method. This is significantly faster than the 
previous method based on recursions for the Legendre associated functions and 
the trigonometric functions (which was also not very well optimized).

New in version 1.2:
* It is now possible to compute the lunisolar perturbing acceleration through 
either a "full" formula, including the direct and indirect terms written in
Cartesian coordinates, or through a "truncated" formula, in which the perturbing
acceleration is the derivative of the perturbing function truncated at an order
assigned by the user.

New in version 1.3:
* The code now uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Terrestrial Time (TT).
In particular, TT is used to retrieve lunisolar ephemerides. The initial epoch
(and the outputs) are in UTC. The conversion between TT and UTC is handled
through the iau_dat SOFA subroutine.
* The GMST and the Earth rotation rate are now computed according to the
IERS/IAU 2006 conventions through the iau_gmst06 routine (in the SOFA library)
and the ERR_IAU06 function, respectively.
* A check for collisions with the Moon has been implemented. The check is
activated by toggling the "imcoll" flag in input.txt
